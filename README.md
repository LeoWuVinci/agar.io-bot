# UPDATE 2021 - DO NOT USE.  
This framework was built to foster an environment where players and bots can live together. 
It encouraged the possibility of a client-side API where players and bots played on equal ground.  A WIN-WIN situation.

As proof where real players and bots can coexist, look no further than MOBA minions, Titanfall, and ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PLAYER GAME.

Instead, the agario team actively created obstacles.  Thereby encouraged communicating directly with the server protocol
which encourages a feeder-bot community that is always fighting with the game devs. A LOSE-LOSE situation.


# agario-bot-framework
Agar.io Bot Framework for others to create their own bots.

*Hacks? Cheats?* None of that here. Just bots trying to get along with humans.

You can try out the sample bot included for **free in the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/agario-bot-framework/jlnlogedhgopimklhbhmpnliaclegdhg)**.

Even though the bot included has many different algorithms such
as genetic algorithms and velocity prediction, it is just
an example and isn't optimized to get on the leaderboard.
Please consider it as a sample of what is possible.

Feel free to fork this project and create your own custom bot

## Purpose
The purpose of this bot is to explore decision-making based on statistics instead of
hard-coded rules.  This is not a bot to enhance normal gameplay.  There's also no team-related features.  Considerations should be fairly simple and not need to consider more than one other organism at a time.  This effectly excludes any "advance" strategies.  The code is designed to be
"forked" easily so everything is kept at the bare necessities.  If you want to (for example)
create a better pathfinder, forking the code would be the best choice.

## Main Components
* Binding to Original Game Code
* Action Generators - Generates move, split, and shoot actions.
* Considerations - Game strategies broken down into small pieces.
* Distance-Delayed Best-First Searching
* Bot Intuition - Weighted Averages of considerations.

### How can the bot be improved?
1. Datastructure for making more advance proximity-based considerations
2. More action generators
3. More consideration functions

### Fun Fork Ideas
* Hide'n'seek
* Sniper
* Bet the score
* VIP
